# EmoteRainToggle

You forgot to disable emote rain and now you've failed the hard song because of it, haven't you? And now you remembered to disable it, but forgot to re-enable?

This is a small QoL improvement for BeatSaberPLus_ChatEmoteRain that adds a toggle button in the pause menu for emote rain during songs.

Dependencies:
- BeatSaberPLus obviously
- BeatSaberMarkupLanguage
- SiraUtil
